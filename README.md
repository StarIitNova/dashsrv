# dashsrv

Dashsrv is a dashboard server written in C++ to show a basic dashboard of all the servers running on my home server. Note that there is a decent amount of hardcoded stuff as to match my local network, so chances are it wont work exactly as you wish.

Note: our mongoose version is modified

If you came for the minecraft stuff, check out `include/Minecraft/` and `source/Minecraft/`. All files in these should be mostly independent of the rest of the system.
